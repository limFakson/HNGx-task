Project Overview

This repository contains my solution for the Frontend Intern Task. The task involved creating a web page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to display specific personal and real-time data attributes. Each required element had a specified data-testid attribute for easy identification and testing.
Task Description

The task requirements were as follows:

    Display Slack Name prominently.
    Showcase the Slack profile picture with the Slack username as alt text.
    Indicate the current day of the week.
    Display the current UTC time in milliseconds.
    Mention the track (e.g., Frontend).
    Provide a clickable link to my GitHub repository.

Implementation

To fulfill the task requirements, I followed these steps:

    HTML Structure: I created the basic structure of the web page using HTML, including all the required elements with their respective data-testid attributes.

    CSS Styling: I applied CSS styling to enhance the visual appeal of the page. The styling included backgrounds, fonts, colors, and responsive design for better user experience.

    JavaScript for Real-Time Data: I used JavaScript to dynamically update the current day of the week and UTC time in milliseconds. I also added a function to handle errors, such as missing profile pictures or GitHub URLs.

    GitHub Hosting: I hosted the web page on GitHub Pages, making it accessible via the URL https:// limfakson.github.io/HNGx-task/ .

    Testing: I tested the page thoroughly to ensure that all elements were displayed correctly, real-time data updated as expected, and error handling worked as intended. I used the data-testid attributes for testing.

Error Handling

Error handling was implemented to improve user experience:

    Missing Profile Picture: If the Slack profile picture is missing, the code displays a default profile picture and provides a default alt text for accessibility.

    Missing GitHub URL: If the GitHub repository URL is not found, the code displays an error message and removes the link to prevent broken links.

Testing

To ensure the functionality and correctness of the web page, I performed testing by:

    Checking that all elements were displayed as specified in the task description.

    Verifying that the current day of the week and UTC time were updated in real-time.

    Simulating missing profile pictures and GitHub URLs to confirm error handling.
